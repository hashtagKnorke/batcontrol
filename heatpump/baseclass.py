    HeatpumpBaseclass is a base class for heat pump systems, providing a structure for implementing

    Methods:
        activate_mqtt(mqtt_api: mqtt_api.MqttApi):
            Activates the MQTT functionality for the heat pump. Must be implemented by subclasses.

        refresh_api_values():
            Refreshes the API values for the heat pump. Must be implemented by subclasses.

        _get_mqtt_topic() -> str:

        ensure_strategy_for_time_window(start_time: datetime, end_time: datetime):
            Plans for high price window. Must be implemented by subclasses.

        set_heatpump_parameters(net_consumption: np.ndarray, prices: dict):
            Sets the parameters for the heat pump based on net energy consumption and energy prices.
